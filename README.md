# 📏 Euclidean vs Manhattan Distance – Streamlit App

An interactive **Streamlit web application** that visually explains and compares  
**Euclidean Distance (L2 norm)** and **Manhattan Distance (L1 norm)**, two fundamental
distance metrics used in Machine Learning.

This project is designed for **beginners**, students, and anyone learning
distance-based algorithms like **KNN**, **K-Means**, and clustering methods.


## 🚀 Live Demo
👉 Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces:  
https://huggingface.co/spaces/Siddhartha001/euclidean-manhattan-distance


## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- **Euclidean Distance (L2)**
  - Straight-line distance between two points
- **Manhattan Distance (L1)**
  - Grid-based distance (horizontal + vertical movement)
- Geometric intuition using plots
- Distance field heatmaps


## ✨ Features

- Interactive selection of two 2D points
- Real-time distance calculation
- Visual comparison of distance paths
- Heatmap visualization for both distance metrics
- Simple and clean UI using Streamlit
